# Complete Supabase Setup Guide for FLUS MVP

## üìã Step-by-Step Database Setup

### Step 1: Create a new Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: flus-mvp (or any name)
   - **Database Password**: (save this password!)
   - **Region**: West EU (Copenhagen) - closest to Norway
4. Click **Create new project** and wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 2: Copy your credentials

1. After project creation, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy:
   - **Project URL** (like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (long token)
3. Create `.env.local` file in project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Create database schema

### 3.1 Open SQL Editor

1. In Supabase Dashboard go to **SQL Editor** (icon `</>`)
2. Click **New query**

### 3.2 Execute main SQL

Copy **all** SQL from file `supabase/migrations/00_complete_schema.sql` and execute it.

This SQL will create:

- ‚úÖ **users** - Users (workers and employers)
- ‚úÖ **jobs** - Jobs with enhanced fields (address, schedule, requirements)
- ‚úÖ **applications** - Job applications + completion status tracking
- ‚úÖ **conversations** - Chats between worker and employer
- ‚úÖ **messages** - Chat messages (text + photos + system events)
- ‚úÖ **job_photos** - Work photos (before/after)
- ‚úÖ **achievements** - Achievements for gamification
- ‚úÖ **user_achievements** - Earned user achievements
- ‚úÖ **cv_entries** - User work experience entries
- ‚úÖ **skills** - User skills and competencies

**Security policies (RLS):**
- ‚úÖ Workers see only their applications
- ‚úÖ Employers see only their jobs and applications
- ‚úÖ Chat participants see only their messages
- ‚úÖ Photos visible only to application participants

### 3.3 Execute flexible roles migration

**New**: Users can now switch between worker and employer roles freely in the UI. Execute the SQL from `supabase/migrations/03_flexible_roles.sql`:

```sql
-- Allow flexible role switching
ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS users_role_check;
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_role_check CHECK (role IN ('worker', 'employer'));

-- Add default role for existing users
UPDATE users SET role = 'worker' WHERE role IS NULL OR role NOT IN ('worker', 'employer');
```

This allows user registration without requiring real Supabase authentication.

### 3.4 Fix RLS for cookie-based authentication

**Important**: Execute SQL from `supabase/migrations/04_fix_rls_for_cookie_auth.sql` in SQL Editor.

This makes RLS policies work with cookie sessions. After running this, job creation will work correctly.

## üì∏ Step 4: Setup Storage for photos

### 4.1 Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New bucket**
3. Settings:
   - **Name**: `job-photos`
   - **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ **YES** (so URLs work without auth)
   - **File size limit**: `5MB`
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp`
4. Click **Create bucket**

### 4.2 Setup Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, execute SQL from `supabase/migrations/01_storage_policies.sql`:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload photos to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload photos to own folder"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'job-photos' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow viewing all photos (for application participants)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view photos from their applications"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'job-photos');

-- Allow deleting own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'job-photos' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

## üéØ Step 5: Verify setup

### 5.1 Check tables

In **Table Editor** you should see all tables:
- users
- jobs
- applications
- conversations
- messages
- job_photos
- achievements
- user_achievements

### 5.2 Check Storage

In **Storage** you should have bucket `job-photos` with configured policies.

### 5.3 Check RLS

All tables should have RLS enabled (green shield üõ°Ô∏è in Table Editor).

---

## üöÄ Step 6: Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Test scenario:

#### As employer:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Select **Arbeidsgiver** (üíº)
3. Click **Logg inn med Vipps**
4. Go to `/jobber/ny`
5. Create test job with:
   - Address
   - Schedule type (Fleksibel/Frist/Fast tid)
   - Requirements

#### As worker:
1. Open another browser/profile
2. Go to `/login`
3. Select **Jobbs√∏ker** (üë∑)
4. Click **Logg inn med Vipps**
5. Find job in `/jobber`
6. Submit application
7. In chat send "Starting work"
8. **Upload "before" photos**
9. After completion **upload "after" photos**
10. Mark work as completed

#### As employer (verification):
1. Return to first browser
2. Go to `/samtaler`
3. Open chat with worker
4. **View "before" and "after" photos**
5. Approve work completion

## üìÅ Photo storage structure

```
job-photos/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {worker_user_id}/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {application_id}/
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ before_timestamp.jpg
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ before_timestamp_2.jpg
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ after_timestamp.jpg
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ after_timestamp_2.jpg
```

**Example:**
```
job-photos/u_abc123def/a_xyz789abc/before_1729520000.jpg
```

---

## üîß Useful SQL queries for debugging

### View all applications with photos:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.id,
  j.title as job_title,
  u.email as worker_email,
  a.status,
  COUNT(jp.id) as photo_count
FROM applications a
JOIN jobs j ON a.job_id = j.id
JOIN users u ON a.applicant_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN job_photos jp ON a.id = jp.application_id
GROUP BY a.id, j.title, u.email, a.status;
```

### View worker statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM worker_statistics 
WHERE worker_id = 'u_xxx';
```

### View employer statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_statistics 
WHERE employer_id = 'u_xxx';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes

1. **RLS enabled on all tables** - data is protected
2. **Storage bucket is public** - photo URLs work without auth
3. **Photos cannot be deleted after work approval** - fraud protection
4. **Employer must approve** work for status to change to `completed`
5. **System messages** are created automatically on work status changes

---

## üìû Next steps

After database setup, you need to:

1. ‚úÖ Implement API for photo uploads
2. ‚úÖ Create UI for photo uploads in chat
3. ‚úÖ Add photo gallery in chat
4. ‚úÖ Implement work approval by employer
5. ‚úÖ Add notifications for new photos

Ready to help with implementation of any of these features! üöÄ
